OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Oh, FYI.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : We&#39;re making a totally new map.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Cold and no air in there...
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Nice minecart track
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : This is the old one./
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Yeah.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ll get out the carts.

OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Whoops.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Debugging code ther.e
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hehe.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Wow this thing is spammy
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hehe.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Debugging code.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Sorry.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Go back round.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : That&#39;s interesting
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : When I moved this way I was thrown out of the car
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Oh, yeah.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Yet I still get the spam
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : The spam is broadcast to the world.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Oh
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Debugging stuff, I must have forgotten to remove it.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Tram controls, push in the direction your facing to go.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : But you did see the cart throw me out right?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : The other direction to stop.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : OH GOD NO AIR HERE EITHER
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : The other 2 directions cause you to exit.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Sec, reversing round.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Come back.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : There&#39;s no air in the chapel
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Like I said, temporary map :)
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hop it the one behind me.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Choo choo!
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : LOL
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : This last one?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : It&#39;s a freight train

OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : So yeah.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : This will be one of the many planned methods of transport./
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Shiny
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Space Monorail!
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ve got a customisable vehicle system planned.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Like Cataclysm&#39;s.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Even better!
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Using instancing.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I also did these.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Train with guns on it
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : You need to be able to hack the train to run people over though...
ADMIN: Gamer_cad/(Jaylen Costello) spawned /obj/machinery/kit_dispenser at (81,132,1)
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Examine the kit.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Each kit requires components.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Shiny
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Which are gathered from the scavenging system.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Which is also coded.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : You&#39;ve been busy
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : They then have a sequence to build them.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : The kits I&#39;m proud of.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : You can&#39;t load the kits onto the tram
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Yeah, they&#39;re not crates.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : But you have to drag them like crates...
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I might add that feature though.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hrrm.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Just an observation
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Yeah, the kits are actually randomly generated.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : LOL
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : But they&#39;ll be the exact same across rounds.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : I got it on the tram
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Crateception.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : And I guess that works.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : That&#39;s not their final icon, btew.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ve got a custom one coming.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Shiny
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : But yeah, the kits components?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : They&#39;re generated using the name as a seed.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : So they&#39;ll be the same across rounds, but they don&#39;t need the required components hard coding.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : So, they may not need the same components each time?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : They&#39;ll always need the same components, unless their name is changed in the source.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Shiny
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hrrrm. What else.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : WHEE
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Gotta love the trams.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ve got a communications system planned that means relay towers are required to transmit.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Just testing to ensure it remembers the crate in the crate in the tram&#39;s contents
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Ooh
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I need to rewrite comms really, but I&#39;m just modding it for now.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Making it so only if you&#39;re in range of a comms tower does the radio work.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;m also adding shortwave too.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Like walkie talkie style.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : gotta love ORANGE
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : :P
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Anything else Spiffy Spoffy?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hrrm.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Mining is being redone completely to use mining installations and encourage base building.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Your spawn area needs windows to keep the cold out
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Richard has made a dynamic weather system I&#39;ve yet to see work.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Map is being redone from scratch.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Understood
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : What&#39;s wrong with the weather system?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : No idea.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : In my times spent testing, I&#39;ve just never observed it change.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : It&#39;s MEANT to snow.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ve seen it snowing. But never during my testing.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : If you&#39;re wondering, this is a really old mars source.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : It&#39;s a slightly modified really old goon.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : That&#39;s why it&#39;s all silky smooth.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : But that&#39;s also where some trouble is caused.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I&#39;ll need to rewrite research. Make a new engine. 
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : And possibly other things.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Now THAT&#39;S crateception
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I wanted you here to help me work out what I need to do.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : And... lol!
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : T.A.R.D.I.C
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Time and relative dimension in crates.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : They&#39;re bigger on the inside.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Crates with space in them, interesting concept
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Instead of slots like bags and junk, have a volume calculation
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : You could even have thermal ones for the medical crates to prevent heat damage to things like plasma
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Or fridges
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : That would be interesting.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Very much so
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Y&#39;know. I bet crates are by default heatproof.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : But that&#39;s probably not why you want me here :P
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : You&#39;re here for any and all feedback :P
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : People can&#39;t get in them though :D
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : OH
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : This is a fun thing
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Uhho
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : That came with the source.

OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Hehe.

OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Still, I&#39;m adding new features one step at a time/
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I really want to play up the idea of being on a planet.
ADMIN: Gamer_cad/(Jaylen Costello) jumped to 122,104,1 in Primary Tool Storage
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : It&#39;s an interesting concept
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Mhhm. I&#39;m hopeful I can get it to play out as well as I hope I can.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : The main issue is revamping systems, and making sure it has enough content.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I can&#39;t match /tg/ for content, not on my own.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Well the nuclear reactor doesn&#39;t work
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Oh, yeah, it&#39;s borked as hell.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Pending a total rewrite.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Medical I think is fine.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : THere was something interesting actually on the TG forums
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Oh?
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : A Turbine engine system
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Nuclear based but it&#39;s more than just a crude icon in a big room
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : SOunds interesting.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I might read it over.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : EHEHEHE
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I was either going to just go Nuclear, or maybe use fusion or something.

OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Then ran onto it because I felt like it.
OOC: Hubert Hughes/Mord_Sith : Did you?
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : I did. Then ran back onto it for fun.
OOC: Jaylen Costello/Gamer_cad : Oh you bastard.
